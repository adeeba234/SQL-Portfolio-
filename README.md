SQL CASE STUDY FOODIE-FI

INTRODUCTION:

Foodie-Fi is a cool website where you can sign up to watch lots of cooking shows from all over the world. Danny, who started Foodie-Fi, knows that to make the website even better, he has to look at what shows people like and how they watch them. This study is all about how Danny uses numbers to make good choices for Foodie-Fi, making it a favorite place for people who love food.

Danny and his friends launched a new startup Foodie-Fi and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world.

This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions on customer journey, payments, and business performances.
